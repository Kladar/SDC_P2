## This is a machine learning pipeline based on LeNet that can classify street signs in the data set at 99% accuracy.

It was trained on an AWS GPU in Oregon, and I watched it train with my laptop tethered to my LTE WIFI hotspot in rural central Wisconsin. The future is here and it's amazing. 

Machine Learning is still magic to me.
